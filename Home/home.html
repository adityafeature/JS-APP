          Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Robotic Automation, RPA, Blue-Prism, Dev-Ops, Cloud Technolgoies, Amazon, Drone, Hadoop, Big Data Technologies. But it continues to be a trend to watch because its effects
          on how we live, work, and play are only in the early stages. In addition,
          other branches of AI have developed, including Machine Learning, which we
          will go into below</p>
        <h3>Global IT Tech Stack</h3>
        <p>Machine Learning is a subset of AI. With Machine Learning, computers are programmed to learn to do something they are not programmed to do: they learn by discovering patterns and insights from data. In general, we have two types of learning, supervised and unsupervised.While Machine Learning is a subset of AI, we also have subsets within the domain of Machine Learning, including neural networks, natural language processing (NLP), and deep learning. Each of these subsets offers an opportunity for specializing in a career field that will only grow.</p>
        <p>AI Machine Learning, Robotic Process Automation, or RPA, is another technology that is automating jobs. RPA is the use of software to automate business processes such as interpreting applications, processing transactions, dealing with data, and even replying to emails. RPA automates repetitive tasks that people used to do. These are not just the menial tasks of a low-paid worker: up to 45 percent of the activities we do can be automated, including the work of financial managers, doctors, and CEOs.</p>
