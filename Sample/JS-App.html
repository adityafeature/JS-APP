  <p>
      Artificial Intelligence, or AI, has already received a lot of buzz in
      recent years, but it continues to be a trend to watch because its effects
      on how we live, work, and play are only in the early stages. In addition,
      other branches of AI have developed, including Machine Learning, which we
      will go into below. AI refers to computer systems built to mimic human
      intelligence and perform tasks such as recognition of images, speech or
      patterns, and decision making. AI can do these tasks faster and more
      accurately than humans.

    <h3>Investors Relations</h3>

    <p>Machine Learning is a subset of AI. With Machine Learning, computers are programmed to learn to do something they are not programmed to do: they learn by discovering patterns and insights from data. In general, we have two types of learning, supervised and unsupervised.While Machine Learning is a subset of AI, we also have subsets within the domain of Machine Learning, including neural networks, natural language processing (NLP), and deep learning. Each of these subsets offers an opportunity for specializing in a career field that will only grow.</p> 
    <h3>End to End soutions for all Technologies</h3>   

    <p>Like AI and Machine Learning, Robotic Process Automation, or RPA, is another technology that is automating jobs. RPA is the use of software to automate business processes such as interpreting applications, processing transactions, dealing with data, and even replying to emails. RPA automates repetitive tasks that people used to do. These are not just the menial tasks of a low-paid worker: up to 45 percent of the activities we do can be automated, including the work of financial managers, doctors, and CEOs.</p>
    <h3>Global IT Tech Stack</h3>
    <p> Edge Computing Formerly a technology trend to watch, cloud computing has become mainstream, with major players AWS (Amazon Web Services), Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud dominating the market. The adoption of cloud computing is still growing, as more and more businesses migrate to a cloud solution. But itâ€™s no longer the emerging technology. </p>
